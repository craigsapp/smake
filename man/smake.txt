SMAKE(1)            UNIX Programmer's Manual             SMAKE(1)



NAME
     smake - Simple MAKE.  Executes a command string embedded in
     a file.

SYNOPSIS
     smake [-s skip][-v variant |-c][-e|-x] input-file [parame-
           ters]

DESCRIPTION
     Smake searches for the character pattern $Smake: in a file.
     When it finds that pattern, smake will execute, as a shell
     command, the text following $Smake: to the end of the line.

     There are several symbolic patterns that can be used in the
     embedded command:

     %f       If this character pattern is in the embedded com-
              mand, the input filename passed to smake will be
              substituted.

     %b       If this character pattern is in the command, the
              filename minus the characters after the last period
              will be removed, as well as the last period.  For
              example, the basename of test.c is test .

     %<newl>  Where <newl> is the newline character. If % comes
              at the end of the line with no other characters
              except the newline character following it, the
              embedded command continues on the following line.
              The -s option determines where the command resumes
              on the next line.

     %1--%9   If any parameters follow the input-file on the com-
              mand line, then these parameters get matched to the
              symbols %1, %2, etc. up to %9.  If there is no
              passed parameter for a particular symbol, then it
              is left unchanged in the command.

OPTIONS
     -s skip  skip is the number of characters to skip at the
              beginning of a new line for the shell command
              line-continuation.  The default value of skip is 4.
              It is an error to skip beyond the end of the line.

     -v variant
              variant is a string used to distinguish between
              different possible commands to extract.  The form
              of the marker in the file is $Smake-variant:.

     -e       echo the embedded command string without executing
              it.

     -x       execute the command string only, without printing
              it to the terminal as well.

     -c pattern
              pattern is a string to replace the default marker
              $Smake: with pattern.

EXAMPLES
     A command to compile a c program, and strip the executable:

     // $Smake:    gcc -O -o %b %f && strip %b

     A command to produce and display a PostScript file from a
     TeX file:

     % $Smake:     tex %b && dvips -o %b.ps %b && open %b.ps

BUGS
     Cannot use the -v option and the -c option at the same time.
